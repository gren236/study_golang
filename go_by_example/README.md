`go build` is used to build a binary. Without any params, it just outputs binary to the file with the same name.

`go run` is interpreter mode. Need to test interpreter vs compiler performance.

`main` package declared in each file present inside this directory, so be sure to pass a specific file to compiler/interpreter.
