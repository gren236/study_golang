# Study GoLang

Repository for GoLang studying purposes

It's updated as new knowledge arrives :)
See NOTES.md to find some useful (I believe) notes on studying go-related stuff. These has two main purposes:

1. Be sure to remember everything I've learnt so far
2. Share my learning thoughts with everyone
