# Study GoLang

## Introduction

Repository for GoLang studying purposes

It's being updated as new knowledge arrives :)
See NOTES.md to find some useful (I believe) notes on studying go-related stuff. These has two main purposes:

1. Be sure to remember everything I've learnt so far
2. Share my learning thoughts with everyone

Cheers :3

# Learning Notes

So, this section is about my path of learning Golang. This document is organised in ascending chronological order (first thing after these lines is what I've managed to study first) and it has the most general information about the whole recearch cycle. Find directory level specific `NOTES.md` to find out more in the context of directory topic. I recommend following the path below just to know where to start and where to `Go` next :)

## Tour of Go
[Link](https://tour.golang.org)

Looks like a solid starting point for someone who seeks basic knowledge of Go. Also, a great way to find out if you are interested in the Go language at all. But it lacks a deeper description and documentation on some things. Also, don't forget to check out all the links on the last slide.

## How To Write Go Code

[Article](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

A nice article (screencast) containing the basics of Go tooling. Again, it won't give you a whole picture, but a great starting point instead. More like introduction. By the way, the article is better than the screencast as it's not so up-to-date.

## Run.go
A great Medium series of articles which give some deep understanding of basic Golang concepts. It's a good idea to support some basic studing with these articles.
